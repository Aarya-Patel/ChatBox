# ChatBox
Created a terminal chatbox application using Socket.io and Node.js to allow users to connect and chat with each other.

# How to use
Firstly clone the repo at your desired destination. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Aarya-Patel/ChatBox.git
```

Secondly install all the dependencies.
```npm install```

Next you want to open a terminal and run the server.js and connect to the server with client.js by running it in another terminal window.
```
// Terminal 1
node server.js

//Terminal 2
node client.js

//Terminal 3
node client.js
```

Now your clients in Terminal 2,3 are connected to the server and can now talk to each other!
